"""The README's top picture still shows the menu the tool opens.

The root menu used to sit in the README as text; since 2026-09-19 it is
`assets/menu.png`, and a picture cannot be diffed. Its alt text can: it names
every root row, so a row added, renamed or moved in `menu.ROOT_ITEMS` fails
here until the picture is taken again and the alt text follows it
(AGENTS.md -> Working here says how).
