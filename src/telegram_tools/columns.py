"""How a name is measured and cut so the ID column beside it lines up.

Telegram chat titles carry emoji, and `len()` is the wrong ruler for them: a
variation selector (U+FE0F) is a codepoint that draws nothing of its own, and
an emoji draws two columns. Padding on `len()` is what puts one row of the
chat picker a column out of line: the terminal draws `⚙️ Alerts` and
`📚 Vaults` at the same 9 columns, and `len()` calls them 9 and 8.

Ported unchanged from the sibling discord-tools, where the same bug was found
in a live picker and fixed on 2026-08-31; the two copies are meant to stay
identical.
