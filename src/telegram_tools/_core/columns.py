"""How a name is measured and cut so the ID column beside it lines up.

Names in a picker carry emoji, and `len()` is the wrong ruler for them: an
emoji draws two columns from one codepoint, a variation selector draws none,
and each half of a flag draws two. Padding on `len()` is what puts a row of
a picker a column out of line -- `📚 Vaults` counts 8 characters and draws 9
columns, while `⚠️ Alerts` counts 9 and draws 8.

The rules below were measured against a real terminal on 2026-08-31 by
printing each shape and asking the terminal where the cursor landed, over
plain text, CJK, a combining mark, emoji with and without U+FE0F, a flag, a
skin-tone modifier and two ZWJ sequences -- all fourteen agree. Those fourteen
shapes are the contract: the suite that owns this module carries them as a
table, and a terminal that disagrees is re-measured there, never patched here.
