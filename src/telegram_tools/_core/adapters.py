"""The adapter Protocols: the one seam through which platform behaviour enters.

Spec: section 4.3. A Protocol exists here only when both tools implement it
(seam law 3); each tool implements them in its own `adapters/` package, above
its one SDK seam (law 4). An adapter receives an opened client, never a
token, a phone number or a session path (law 6). Names are final. The
signatures below are provisional: nothing implements them yet, and the card
that lands each Protocol settles its signature and may change it freely.
